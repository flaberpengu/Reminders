A simple program to store a todo list<br>
Todo list inside code, but is is also here:

<li>Add proper checking for whether the date entered is valid</li>
<li>Add optional time to each reminder and make notifications</li>
<li>Add a priorities system or options to sort reminders by</li>
<li>Add an icon</li>
<li>Make a scrollbar for when there are too many reminders for the default GUI size (or have pages?)</li>
</ul>
